# TSP-GRIP-July-2024
TOPIC: Prediction UsingUnsupervised Machine Learning (Algorithm Used: K Means Clustering)
# Explanation:
1. Import necessary libraries: Libraries like pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, etc, are used for data manipulation, visualization, and clustering.
2. Load the dataset: The Iris dataset is loaded from the provided CSV file.
3. Preprocess the data: Features are extracted, and the dataset is standardized.
4. Elbow method: Determines the optimum number of clusters by plotting WCSS (within-cluster sum of squares) for different cluster numbers.
5. K-means clustering: Applies K-means with the chosen number of clusters.
6. PCA visualization: Uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensions for 2D plotting and visualize the clusters.
